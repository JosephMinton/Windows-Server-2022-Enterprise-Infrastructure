This project simulates an enterprise Windows domain environment. The project focuses on building foundational infrastructure and implementing centralized security governance using Active Directory and Group Policy.

The objective is to demonstrate practical competency in Windows Server administration, identity management, and security enforcement within a corporate network model.

- [Active Directory Foundations](https://github.com/JosephMinton/Windows-Server-2022-Enterprise-Infrastructure/blob/main/Active%20Directory%20Domain%20Services%20Foundation.md) Deployed Windows Server 2022 domain environment within VMware. Created GPOs, OUs, groups, and users. It explains group scopes and types, demonstrates how to create groups, and includes a practical exercise to implement these concepts in a basic AD environment.
- [Security Governance with Group Policy](https://github.com/JosephMinton/Windows-Server-2022-Enterprise-Infrastructure/blob/main/Security%20Governance%20via%20Group%20Policy%20Management.md) Implemented centralized administrative control using Group Policy to enforce password policies, system restrictions, and enterprise wide configuration standards across the domain.
